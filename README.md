## scramble

This mobile app will be a food shopping list that automatically categorises items based on where in the store you can get them, and autopopulates the shopping list with ingredients of a chosen recipe. This is inspired by the desire to cook new and more varied vegan recipes more easily.

#### Tech

The app will use the Edmame recipe API and will be built using Express and React Native, using REST APIs. The rationale for the tech stack was to use backend tech I haven't used before, while keeping the frontend familiar.
