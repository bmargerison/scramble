## scramble

This mobile app will firstly be a food shopping list that authomatically categorises items based on where in the store you can get them. This will then be built upon by using a recipe API (edmamam) to autopopulate the shopping list with the ingredients of a chosen recipe.

This is inspired by the desire to escape the calamity of the sometimes unavoidable Saturday grocery shop as quickly as possible, and also the desire to cook new and more varied vegan recipes more easily.

#### Tech

The app will be built using Express and React Native, using REST APIs. The rationale for the tech stack was to use backend tech I haven't used before, while keeping the frontend familiar.
